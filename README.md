# document-comparison-project
Collaborative research project


I am currently involved in a collaborative effort to provide a professor and researcher with text document comparison data. My part in the research involves gathering, cleansing, normalizing, and processing a fairly large body of data; very exciting stuff. As much as I would like to share some code right now, I feel that it is best to hold off, out of professional courtesy. Although I cannot go into too much detail about the data or goals at present, I would be happy to further discuss methods and technologies.
